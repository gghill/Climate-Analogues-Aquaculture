# Climate-Analogues-Aquaculture
Constructing climate analogues to inform global aquaculture development

The [scripts](https://github.com/gghill/Climate-Analogues-Aquaculture/tree/main/Scripts), base [data](https://github.com/gghill/Climate-Analogues-Aquaculture/tree/main/Data), and [results](https://github.com/gghill/Climate-Analogues-Aquaculture/tree/main/Results) (of both modeling and visualization) are contained here. Large database files associated with the spatial information underlying the analyses are contained separately, but are necessary for running the scripts.
